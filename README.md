# 💡 MammoAI - Breast Cancer Detection 💻

## 🔍 Overview

**MammoAI** is a machine learning model designed to assist in detecting breast cancer from mammogram images. Utilizing advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this project offers a simple user interface where users can upload mammogram images and receive instant predictions on whether cancer is detected.

## ✨ Features

- 🖼️ Image upload functionality through a user-friendly GUI.
- 🤖 AI-powered breast cancer prediction using CNNs.
- 📂 Supports JPEG and PNG images.
- ⚡ Fast, reliable, and easy to use.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Install the Required Libraries:**  
   Run the following commands to install the required libraries.
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tk pillow
   ```

2. **Run the Application:**  
   Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python mammoAI.py
   ```

3. **Upload an Image:**  
   A GUI will appear where you can upload a mammogram image. The AI model will analyze the image and display the result ("🟢 Cancer Detected" or "🔵 No Cancer Detected").

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow, Pillow, Tkinter, Numpy, Scikit-learn

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- 🧠 Adding more powerful models (e.g., ResNet, VGG) for improved accuracy.
- 🌐 Adding a web-based version for easier accessibility.
- 📊 Allowing bulk image analysis and generating detailed reports.
